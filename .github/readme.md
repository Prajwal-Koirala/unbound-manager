### Q&A
What's the best way for me to make my own list?
- Open the repo after forking and cloning it. Go ahead and change the `urls` struct, replacing the urls there with the lists you wish to use, and then just run the file using the command `go run main.go`.

What's the best way to add my own exclusions?
- Simply open the exclusion file, add a domain, and submit a pull request; if your pull request is merged, the domain will be excluded the next time the list is updated.

Is the list updated on a regular basis?
- We strive to update the list every 24 hours, but this cannot be guaranteed, and if it is not updated for any reason please let us know.
